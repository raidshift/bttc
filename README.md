# raidshift

* Raidshift is a fully decentralized protocol for private transactions on BitTorrent-Chain (BTTC) forked from https://tornado.cash/.
* Its smart contracts are immutable, have no admins, and the proofs are based on strong cryptography (zk-SNARKs). Only a user possessing a private note is able to link deposit and withdrawal of tokens.
* Raidshift supports following token deposits: USDT_t.
* Tornado Cashs's Relayer functionality is currently not supported.
* Neither Raidshift nor any other party collects protocol fees from deposits or withdrawals - the protocol is free of charge.
